What do we want:
- Vanilla experience 100% sans bugs and inconviniences

What do we need still:
- A system for moving camera to events in battle (callback?)
- When enemy spotted for the first time we pause mission and give event
- When no action visible to player happens for 1 second hide behind screen
- When screen is shown fast forward updates and cull walking sounds
- When action first visible to player move camera to center on action and remove screen
- When interrupting center on the first interrupting unit

Order for proper map generation:
- Generate smallest map
- Init map with map parts only
- For every player los block, LOS to every enemy LOS block (adhering to limit of range 20), and remove spawn for blocks that are visible.
- Calculate amount of spawn tiles for enemies, compare to required amount multiplied by some constant (like 2x)
- If not enough and map has variable size then increase map size and try again
