What do we want:
- Vanilla experience 100% sans bugs and inconviniences

What do we need still:
- A system for moving camera to events in battle (callback?)
- When enemy spotted for the first time we pause mission and give event
- When no action visible to player happens for 1 second hide behind screen
- When screen is shown fast forward updates and cull walking sounds
- When action first visible to player move camera to center on action and remove screen
- When interrupting center on the first interrupting unit
- When unit accepts interrupt set it's focus unit, change default ai so that it can only attack focus unit if interrupting, clear focus unit when clearing interrupt units
- (this is wrong!) When unit accepts interrupt check it's behavior and movement, if aggressive or can't move, ensure it has lof to triggering unit, and in range, and can afford an attack, otherwise order turn and do not accept
- Instead, we should think() and only give interrupt if decision was made
- MDGA! decisions!

Proper handling of decisions:
- Decision is something unit is doing currently
- What does AI do?
	LowMoraleAI: simply does it's thing, cares not for what was going on before
	DefaultAI: turns to attacker, start firing on enemy if not firing, prefer focus enemy
