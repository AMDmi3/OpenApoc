Turn Based:

- There is currentActiveOrg, one that is taking its turn
- There is a list of interruptUnits - units that are currently interrupting current org's turn
- TacticalAI decides for other orgs when to give up it's turn. Player decides for players.

When not our turn:

- No AI functions
- No advancement available in missions
- No control available

When our interrupt:

- Only LowMorale, Default, Behavior AI functions, and only up to a TU limit (if TU lower than limit then no function)
- LowBehavior AI additionally wastes all remaining TUs of a unit if no TU
- When unit on interrupt not active for more than a second it is removed from interrupt units list
- When interrupt units list is clear interrupt is over and control resumes for currentActiveOrg

Interrupt triggers:

- After morale checks are done at the beginning of the turn, each lowmorale unit makes a notification and is given interrupt
- Units from active org are not given chance to interrupt (except condition above)
- When we change position, give interrupt chance to every unit that sees us
- When unit is hit, give interrupt chance to that unit
- Interrupt chance includes RemainingTU * Reaction value. Unit only accepts interrupt if it's value is greater, and only up to TU value that still makes it greater.
  Ex: 40/80 TU 20R unit fires at 20/60 40R unit. Value 10 vs 13,333 allows interrupt, but only up to 10 which is 15 TU. 
  Therefore unit's interrupt TUs limit is 15. When unit' TUs go below this level his interrupt will end.
