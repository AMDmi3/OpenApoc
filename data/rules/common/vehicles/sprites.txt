UFOs in type order
Seem to have some frames of animation,then the 'destroyed' image

Types 1/2 have 6 frames of animation
Types 3-8 have 12
Type 9 has 3
Type 10 has 6

That gives us a total of 103 images (offset 102 is the last ufo)

offset 103 is the first human one

Order of images in 'human' section:
(N = decreasing 'y' in citymap, W = decreasing 'x')
All in sets of 8, for N NE E SE S SW W NW
8 'flat' images:

8 'decending' images:
8 'ascending' images

16 'banking right' (clockwise) images

That's a total of 56 images per type (if all images present - note that
the space liner doesn't have ascending/decending or banking images)
