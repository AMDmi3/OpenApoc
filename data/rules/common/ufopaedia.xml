      <title>Organizations</title>
      <text_info>The Organizations which operate in Mega-Primus consist of corporations, political groups, criminal gangs and the government. All of them are at risk from Alien infiltration but some are more vulnerable than others. </text_info>

          <backgroundimage>xcom3/UFOPAEDI/27XCOM.PCX</backgroundimage>
          <text_info>The Extraterrestrial combat force known as X-COM was originally founded in 1998 to defend the Earth from Alien invasion. After a period of obsolescence, X-COM was revived in 2040 to fight the second Alien war under the seas of the Earth. X-COM has now been enlisted to investigate recent Alien incursions. The city's senators have agreed to fund a covert initiative, with the assistance of local Megapol stations, who will pass on reports of possible Alien activity directly to the X-COM base commander. X-COM is under pressure to solve the Alien problem before new elections to the Senate. Senators and the corporate elite of Mega-Primus are nervous about the prospect of popular panic undermining the social fabric of the city.</text_info>

          <text_info>The Alien scare first began on 7th March, 2084 when a strange Dimension Gate appeared in the skies above Mega-Primus. During the following days strange UFOs came and went, but they did not appear to attack anything or abduct anyone. It was only when strange reports of Alien monsters lurking in the recesses of city buildings filtered through to the senatorial security committee that the plan to enlist X-COM was proposed.</text_info>

          <text_info>Mega-Primus is a city state ruled by thirteen elected senators. This Government is directly responsible for the legal system and the mass transit systems. All other city services, including the policing of the city, are contracted to various corporations. In practice the immense bureaucracy holds the most power. Senior civil servants are responsible for maintaining the city edicts and defining citizenship and its obligations. They cannot be removed from their jobs except through proven misconduct.</text_info>

          <text_info>Megapol not only runs the city police force and prison service, it also manufactures vehicles, weapons and munitions. It directly competes with the Marsec corporation for lucrative markets in the mining colonies and Mega-Primus. The major problems for Megapol are the criminal gangs that distribute Psiclone and the UFO incursions which are regarded as a threat to city security. Police vehicles bravely intercept UFOs as they materialize from the Dimension Gates, but they are woefully under equipped to deal with them.</text_info>

          <text_info>This bizarre cult has whipped up a religious frenzy following the appearance of the Dimension Gates. The cult has long believed in redemption of the human race by a superior Alien race. They believe the UFOs and Aliens to be harmless and are rapidly gaining credibility and recruits from the general population. This represents a considerable threat to X-COM because the cultists will do anything to assist the Aliens in their purpose, whatever that might be.</text_info>

          <text_info>The ominous and highly secretive Marsec corporation took over from X-COM as the leading provider of off-world security, as X-COM centered its activities around Mega-Primus. During the initial years of their operation Marsec was empowered to impose order on the rebellious Mars colony. Marsec (Mars Security) developed high technology weaponry and vehicles by recruiting top Scientists from Earth and using the equipment left by X-COM. With the establishment of the remote Elerium mining colonies, Marsec secured contracts for military equipment despite competition from Megapol.</text_info>

          <text_info>The refinement of Elerium powered anti-grav propulsion units has created a new industry for ecologically friendly power sources. Superdynamics has developed sophisticated plants for producing power units of all sizes as well as a variety of airborne anti-grav vehicles. The cost of manufacture is high and Elerium is also in short supply. This means that privately owned vehicles are rare, but  Superdynamics developed and installed the anti-grav system for the People Tubes. These safe and efficient tube ways rapidly became the mass transit system for Mega-Primus in direct competition to the road network.</text_info>

          <text_info>The General Metro corporation designs and manufactures road vehicles. Since the corporation installed an efficient anti-grav system inside the road structure it became possible to produce low powered anti-grav road vehicles which were cheap and efficient, despite being limited to the road system. The vehicle designs were based on the exuberant styling of the 1950s according to the requirements of city planners. General Metro is a major competitor to Superdynamics, as both corporations provide transport systems.</text_info>

          <text_info>The Cyberweb corporation developed artificial life forms to provide a willing and obedient workforce for the future. However, popular protest against unemployment forced the Senate to pass laws against artificial life. No more Androids could be built and they were banned from employment except the most menial and degrading jobs. Cyberweb had to change strategy and compete with the Nanotech corporation for medical and military contracts. The unfortunate Androids were either banished from the city or had to be bought and sold as household servants or pets. Androids are good for combat, although they possess no Psionic abilities, and the few that remain may well risk seeking employment by X-COM and join the battle against the Aliens.</text_info>

They also own many warehouses spread throughout the city which are used by many corporations involved in importing and exporting. The city goods transport service and the taxi service are owned and run by Transtellar. The corporation has been regarded suspiciously by Megapol which considers the corporation susceptible to Alien contamination.</text_info>

          <text_info>The discovery of Elerium sources in distant solar systems has produced a new gold rush. The Solmine corporation owns most of the mining operations and it imports Elerium directly to Mega-Primus. These mining operations sustain the economies of the numerous small colonies, but they are still governed from Earth. There have been demands for independence and some rebellions. Major corporations, fearing diminished profits and raised Elerium prices have suppressed these revolts with the aid of Solmine and Marsec.</text_info>

          <text_info>The entertainment industry entered a new phase with the advent of Psionic projectors. Actors connected to Psionic sensors can record their thoughts and experiences in any environment. The recorded patterns are edited into 'Sensovision'  experiences and replayed at 'Sensodromes' where many people can connect to Psionic receivers. The receiver allows people to see, hear, feel and smell what the actor experienced. Sensoviosion actors are wealthy celebrities and the Sensovision corporation is now selling the expensive receiver sets into peoples homes. The only competition comes from the addictive and illegal Psionic implant known as Psiclone, which is supplied by the criminal syndicates.</text_info>

They have developed a controversial but highly effective Psionic tutoring system which imparts knowledge far more efficiently than reading or listening to lecturers. If the student resists the knowledge transfer then pain results. Lifetree have been accused of brainwashing since the introduction of the 'moral education' program which is designed to turn the youth into model citizens.

However, the corporation is wary of attempts by Solmine to create cheaper Elerium energy systems. This can only be achieved by lowering the price of Elerium which could happen if the rebellious mining colonies are totally subdued.</text_info>

          <text_info>GravBall is a fast paced aerial version of Soccer where the players use anti-grav backpacks to fly around an immense stadium. Due to the fast and violent nature of the game, players wear tough armor, injuries are still common though. Cybernetic implants are used to substitute for mangled limbs, but a GravBall player must be at least 50% original human flesh in order to qualify in the GravBall league. Due to the popularity of the sport the GravBall League, which owns all the stadiums in the city, has become a prosperous corporation. However, alternative recreations such as Sensovision or the illegal Psiclone are proving to be serious competition.</text_info>

These hybrids have survived in human society, but they have been denied the right to procreate within the city. They also suffer discrimination in employment and education. Although they are genetically almost identical to humans, they retain some Alien facial characteristics and are renowned (and distrusted) for their Psionic abilities. Hybrids Psionic abilities may well prove useful to X-COM in the war against the Aliens. The Mutant Alliance is active in city politics and promotes the concerns of the hybrid community.</text_info>

Power levels are gradually restored but the unit will cease functioning if the power level is reduced to zero.</text_info>

The gestation period for the Hyperworms is about three days and each Multiworm gives birth to four offspring. The birth process is lethal for the parent - the Hyperworms explode from the Multiworms body and consume it within a matter of seconds. The brain structure of the Multiworm is undeveloped and it is unlikely to be affected by Psionic attacks.

          <text_info>A Chrysalis is the most vulnerable stage of Alien development because it possesses no attack mechanisms. Its skin is tough, but vulnerable to fire and incendiary ammunition. A new Alien will grow inside the Chrysalis and emerge after a period of three days. It seems that a variety of Alien forms could develop at this stage, dependent on the genetic information carried by the Hyperworm. The physiology of these new forms contains many new cell structures. We have now gained a significant understanding of Alien genetics.</text_info>

The cell structures we have discovered seem to suggest that the emerging Aliens have a different physiology to those previously encountered. This could indicate that there will be further stages to our biological research. The Chrysalis contains no advanced brain structure and will not respond to Psionic attacks.</text_info>

There is a well protected brain structure that seems to match human size in terms of its neuron count. The well formed brain is vulnerable to Psionic influence although it is not capable of Psionic attacks. This indicates an important weakness of this species.

          <text_info>The Psimorph is a rare and highly specialized Alien. Its Psionic powers and defense are formidable, it is likely to be used as an Alien commander in battle situations. Despite its ability to fly, its mobility is limited due to its bulk and lack of a skeletal structure. Unlike other Alien types it seems to survive quite well in our environment.

It has limited intelligence and attacks using its funnel head which projects a mix of deadly micro-organisms up to medium range. Despite its humanoid form it is incapable of using other weapons or equipment. It has no eyes, ears or nose but it can accurately detect the presence of nearby organic life forms. This ability is based on a specialized form of Psionic receptor and makes the creature very dangerous in combat situations.</text_info>

Its mobility is severely limited when fully grown and it also requires exactly the right atmospheric conditions in order to breed properly and produce the Alien eggs. These conditions are only provided by the spawning chambers inside an Alien building, which also provide a food source by plugging directly into the Queenspawn's blood supply. This confirms that the Aliens cannot conquer our dimension without a steady supply of Alien reinforcements through the Dimension Gates, although their motive for such incursions is still unknown.</text_info>

          <text_info>It is clear that the Alien life cycle is an extremely rapid sequence of changes. The eggs always develop into Multiworms which then give birth to Hyperworms which form a Chrysalis. At this stage the genetic variation produces a variety of Alien types which develop inside the Chrysalis. The whole process from the egg hatching to emergence from the Chrysalis only seems to take about ten days, provided that there is an adequate supply of food. Fortunately these life forms do not survive very well in our world and it is unclear how an invasion could be successful.</text_info>

The large Alien life forms cannot survive in our dimension - the Micronoids must transfer to a new host in order to conquer our world and the ideal host is our own race. Brainsuckers are used to introduce Micronoids into the human bloodstream which then gain control of the brain and have access to all the knowledge and abilities of the host. We now understand the physiology of the Micronoids sufficiently in order to develop a specific toxin that will kill the organisms in the bloodstream.</text_info>

          <text_info>The Astrodome contains huge stadiums and other facilities for various modern sports. GravBall is the most popular sport in the city, despite being dangerous. Five players in each team are equipped with anti-grav units and ball throwers. The six remaining team members are firmly routed on the ground and are used to protect the goal area or retrieve fallen balls. The maze of corridors and high stands makes the Astrodome a dangerous place for combat.</text_info>

          <text_info>Open fields are unsustainable because of exposure to harmful radiation caused by the collapse of the ozone layer. The Hydro-Farms of Mega-Primus are efficient, clean and highly productive. Their controlled environments can produce any kind of vegetable or fruit, or rear any kind of animal. Unfortunately they are also quite good at nurturing the odd Alien which finds its way inside.</text_info>

          <text_info>The sewage works recycles everything possible from the organic waste produced by the city. The solid waste produces food and fertilizer for the Hydro-Farms. Water is then passed back to the water purifying stations. Since the building is largely automated, its dank, dark maze of pipes and walkways provide an ideal habitat for Alien creatures.</text_info>

          <text_info>City regulations stipulate the highest possible water quality. The tall water purifiers are largely automated buildings and are difficult areas for combat, they also provide good hiding places for Alien spawn. The tall structures are also vulnerable to collapse, so explosive munitions should be avoided.</text_info>
