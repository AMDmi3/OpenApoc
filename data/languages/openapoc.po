msgid "The Alien Dimension consists of a bleak, hostile environment with an organic city. This city undoubtedly constructs Alien craft and nurtures the Alien brood. The structure of the buildings is immensely strong, but there appears to be weak point which will allow our Agents and vehicles to gain access to the building south of the dimension gates. If we can research this building further then we will have the necessary information to send in our squads to destroy it. We should then be able to gain access to the next building via the organic tubing that joins the Alien city together like a giant umbilical cord."

msgstr "This creature is a rapacious carnivore whose feeding frenzy contributes to the rapid growth of younger lifeforms called Hyperworms which are reared inside its body. The gestation period for the Hyperworms is about three days and each Multiworm gives birth to four offspring. The birth process is lethal for the parent - the Hyperworms explode from the Multiworms body and consume it within a matter of seconds. The brain structure of the Multiworm is undeveloped and it is unlikely to be affected by Psionic attacks. The tissue analysis from the autopsy will provide an invaluable contribution to our biological warfare research."

msgid "This creature was built for warfare, immensely strong and aggressive. Underneath the thick outer skin a significant digestive system is revealed. There is a well protected brain structure that seems to match human size in terms of its neuron count. The well formed brain is vulnerable to Psionic influence although it is not capable of Psionic attacks. This indicates an important weakness of this species. The tissues recovered from this specimen will contribute to our biological warfare research."
